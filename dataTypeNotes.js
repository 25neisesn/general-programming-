// These will be notes on data types

// There are 8 datatypes in javascript

/*
1. Numbers (both integers and floating point)
2. BigInt 
    for every large number javascript starts to approximate but u can override this by putting BigInt
3. String- letters words characters numbers symnols that are treated like text
*/

// + with strings makes contactation
// Strungs are formed by encapsulating symbols with quotations
// "Hello" double quotes
// 'Hello' single quotes
// `Hello` backticks

console.log("Hello, World");
console.log('Hello, world');

// if your string contains an apostrophe use double quotes
// if your string contains a quotation use single quotes
